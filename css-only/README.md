# CSS-Only Animations

Simple, reusable CSS animations using custom attributes.

## Usage

1. Include the CSS file in your project (this is already included in the the Global Header component & as a CSS Animations component for use on landing pages)
2. Add the `anim` attribute to elements you want to animate.

Example:

## Available Animations

- Slide Up: `anim="slide-up"`
- Fade In: `anim="fade-in"`
- Flip: `anim="flip"`

## Delayed Animations\*

- Slide Up: `anim="slide-up-300"` (300ms delay)
- Fade In: `anim="fade-in-500"` (500ms delay)
- Flip: `anim="flip-200"` (200ms delay)

\*Delays available in 100ms increments up to 700ms.
